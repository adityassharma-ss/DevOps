<h1 align="center"> CI-CD </h1>

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in the field of DevOps, which aims to improve the collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, and to automate the build, test, and deployment process of software applications.

CI refers to the practice of regularly integrating code changes made by developers into a shared code repository, and automatically building and testing the application to ensure that the changes do not break the application. This allows developers to detect and fix issues early in the development process, and helps to prevent bugs and defects from being introduced into the codebase.

CD refers to the practice of automatically deploying code changes that pass the testing phase to production, or to other environments in the deployment pipeline. This allows for a faster and more efficient deployment process, and reduces the risk of manual errors during the deployment process.

Together, CI and CD help to improve the quality and speed of software development, and enable organizations to deliver software updates and new features to their users more frequently and reliably.

# Continuous Integration

CI involves integrating code changes made by developers into a shared code repository (such as Git) on a regular basis, typically multiple times per day.

When a developer commits their code changes to the repository, a CI server (such as Jenkins or CircleCI) automatically detects the changes and triggers a build process. This typically includes compiling the code, running unit tests and integration tests, and generating any artifacts (such as executables or package files) that are needed for deployment.

If the build process is successful and all tests pass, the code changes are considered ready to be deployed. If the build process fails or any tests fail, the CI server will report the issue and stop the deployment process. This helps to prevent issues from being deployed to production.

CI allows developers to detect and fix issues early in the development process, and helps to prevent bugs and defects from being introduced into the codebase. It also makes it easier for developers to collaborate, as they can integrate their code changes with the main codebase frequently and receive feedback on their changes.

# Continuous Deployment

CD refers to the practice of automatically deploying code changes that pass the testing phase to production, or to other environments in the deployment pipeline.

CD typically involves defining a deployment pipeline, which is a series of environments that code changes go through before being deployed to production. Examples of environments in a deployment pipeline might include a development environment, a staging environment, and a production environment.

When code changes are committed to the code repository and pass the build and testing phase in CI, they are automatically deployed to the next environment in the deployment pipeline. This typically involves using a deployment tool (such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet) to automate the process of installing and configuring the necessary dependencies and software on the target environment.

CD allows organizations to deploy software updates and new features to their users more frequently and reliably, and helps to reduce the risk of manual errors during the deployment process. It also enables organizations to deploy code changes to different environments (such as staging or production) with a single click, rather than having to manually deploy each change.

# CI/CD Tools

There are many CI/CD tools available, including Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, and GitLab CI. These tools typically integrate with code repositories (such as GitHub or GitLab) and deployment tools (such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet), and allow you to define a deployment pipeline that includes multiple environments.

# Jenkins: 

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is commonly used for implementing CI/CD workflows. It provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating various parts of the software development and delivery process. Jenkins can be easily customized and extended through its plugin system to support a wide range of use cases.

# GitLab CI/CD:

GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that includes built-in support for CI/CD workflows. GitLab provides a single application for the entire software development and delivery process, from project planning and source code management to deployment. GitLab includes features such as pipelines, jobs, and artifacts to support building, testing, and deploying software applications.

# Travis CI:

Travis CI is a cloud-based continuous integration service that is designed to be easy to use and integrate with GitHub. It supports a wide range of programming languages and provides a simple web interface for managing builds and deployments.

# CircleCI:

CircleCI is a cloud-based continuous integration and delivery platform that supports a wide range of programming languages and technologies. It provides a simple web interface for managing builds, tests, and deployments, and can be easily integrated with popular tools such as GitHub and Slack.
