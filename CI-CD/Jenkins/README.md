<h1 align="center"> Jenkins </h1>

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is commonly used for implementing CI/CD workflows. It provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating various parts of the software development and delivery process. Jenkins can be easily customized and extended through its plugin system to support a wide range of use cases.

In the context of CI, Jenkins can be used to automate the build and test process of a software application. When a developer commits their code changes to the version control repository (such as Git), Jenkins can automatically detect the changes and trigger a build process. This typically includes compiling the code, running unit tests and integration tests, and generating any artifacts (such as executables or package files) that are needed for deployment.

In the context of CD, Jenkins can be used to automate the deployment process of a software application. After the code changes have been built and tested in the CI phase, Jenkins can automatically deploy the changes to the next environment in the deployment pipeline. This typically involves using a deployment tool (such as ansible, Chef, or Puppet) to automate the process of installing and configuring the necessary dependencies and software on the target environment.

Overall, Jenkins is a popular and powerful tool for implementing CI/CD workflows, and it can be easily customized and extended through its plugin system to support a wide range of use cases.
