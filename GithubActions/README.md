# Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD and automation service provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate various tasks in your software development workflow directly within your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can define workflows using YAML configuration files to build, test, and deploy your code. Workflows are composed of jobs, and jobs are made up of steps that can run commands or actions.
