<h1 align="center"> Serverless Compute </h1>

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed to execute and scale applications. In serverless computing, users only pay for the resources they use, rather than having to pay for a fixed amount of resources.

Serverless computing is often used to build and run applications that are composed of small, independent units of code that are executed in response to events. These units of code are called "functions," and they are typically triggered by events such as the arrival of a new message, the completion of a task, or the expiration of a timer.

Serverless computing allows developers to focus on writing code, rather than managing infrastructure. It also allows for more efficient resource utilization, as resources are only used when needed to execute functions, and are released when the functions are completed.

Some common use cases for serverless computing include building and running microservices, building and running event-driven applications, and building and running serverless APIs.

Overall, serverless computing offers a flexible and cost-effective way to build and run cloud-based applications, particularly for applications that are built using small, independent units of code that are executed in response to events.
