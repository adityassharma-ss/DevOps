<h1 align="center"> Cloud </h1>

Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources over the internet. It allows users to access and use shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

In cloud computing, users access resources and services through the internet rather than using local hardware and software. This means that users can access and use computing resources on demand, without having to purchase and maintain their own physical infrastructure.

There are several different types of cloud computing models, including:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This model provides users with access to infrastructure resources such as servers, storage, and networking.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): This model provides users with access to a platform for building and deploying applications, without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

Software as a Service (SaaS): This model provides users with access to software applications that they can use over the internet, without the need to install and maintain the software on their own machines.

Cloud computing offers several benefits, including reduced costs, increased flexibility, and improved scalability. By using cloud computing, users can access and use computing resources on demand, paying only for what they use, rather than having to invest in and maintain their own physical infrastructure. This makes it easier for businesses and organizations to scale their operations and meet changing needs.
