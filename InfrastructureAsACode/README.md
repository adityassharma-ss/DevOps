Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (like servers, networks, databases, etc.) through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC allows developers and operations teams to automatically manage, monitor, and provision resources, making infrastructure management more efficient, consistent, and scalable.

## Before IaC: Manual Configuration and Provisioning

Before the advent of IaC, infrastructure management was predominantly manual:

    Manual Provisioning: System administrators would manually set up servers, networks, and other infrastructure components. This process was time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to replicate across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

    Scripting: While scripts could be written to automate some parts of the setup, they were often ad-hoc, environment-specific, and lacked consistency. Scripts also did not provide the same level of abstraction or reusability that IaC does.

    Configuration Drift: Over time, manually configured systems would deviate from the intended state due to changes made on the fly, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in troubleshooting.

## Introduction of IaC: Automation and Consistency

With the advent of IaC, the approach to managing infrastructure changed significantly:

    Automation: IaC enables automated provisioning and management of infrastructure. Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation allow infrastructure to be described in code, which can be versioned, tested, and reused.

    Consistency: Since the infrastructure is defined as code, it ensures that the same configuration is applied across all environments, reducing the chances of configuration drift.

    Scalability: IaC allows for the easy scaling of infrastructure. With the code-driven approach, itâ€™s easier to replicate environments, add or remove resources, and manage infrastructure across multiple environments.

    Version Control: Infrastructure configurations can be version-controlled like application code, allowing teams to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate more effectively.

## After IaC: The Future Trends and Developments

The concept of IaC continues to evolve, and there are several emerging trends and technologies:

    Policy as Code: This extends the IaC paradigm to include policies governing infrastructure. Tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) allow teams to define and enforce security, compliance, and operational policies in code, ensuring that infrastructure remains compliant with organizational and regulatory requirements.

    GitOps: This practice applies DevOps principles to infrastructure management. In GitOps, infrastructure changes are made through pull requests in a Git repository, and those changes are automatically applied to the infrastructure, ensuring that the desired state of the infrastructure is always in sync with the code.

    Serverless and Functions as a Service (FaaS): While not directly IaC, serverless architectures abstract away much of the traditional infrastructure management. Developers write code, and the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure. This model shifts some of the focus away from IaC for certain types of applications.

    AIOps and Automation: The integration of AI and machine learning with infrastructure management (AIOps) is becoming more common. AIOps can automate infrastructure management tasks, predict issues, and optimize resources, making infrastructure management even more efficient.
