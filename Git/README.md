<h1 align="center">Git is free and open source software for distributed version control</h1>

Git is a version control system that is used for tracking changes to files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is designed for distributed collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously and track the changes made by each person.

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides version control for software development, as well as a platform for developers to share and collaborate on software projects. GitHub allows users to create and manage Git repositories, track changes to code, and collaborate with other users on projects. It also includes features such as bug tracking, project management tools, and the ability to review and discuss code changes.

To use Git and GitHub, you will need to install Git on your computer and create a GitHub account. Once you have Git installed and your account set up, you can create a new Git repository on your computer and then push it to GitHub, where it can be shared with other users. You can also clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine, make changes to the code, and then push your changes back to GitHub to be incorporated into the project.
