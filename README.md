<h1 align="center"> DevOps </h1>

Welcome to my DevOps repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in improving my understanding and knowledge of DevOps practices and tools.

Here, you will find various work samples and notes on various aspects of DevOps that I have learned and implemented, such as:

    Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
    Containerization and orchestration using tools like Docker and Kubernetes
    Infrastructure as Code using tools like Terraform and Ansible
    Monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus and Elasticsearch
    And more!

I hope that by sharing my progress and learning, I can provide additional resources and help others in their own journey to understand and implement DevOps practices.

Also, You can find all my work samples hosted on my react web app https://devops-phi.vercel.app/ feel free to check it out for more details and insights
